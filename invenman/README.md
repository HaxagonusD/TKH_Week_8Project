# How this inventory application works 
- We are using the inventory.js and product.js classes to hold information
  - We cna easily connect these to a data base if we wanted to 
- Product.js is a compoent to show the individual Products 
- Inventory.js is a component that contains all the products 
- Fm.js is a component that is a form that allows us to input new Products 
- The UI is written with Ant Design for React 

FrontEnd: (Ant Design ( Product.js + Inventory.js + Fm.js))  -|- Backend(inventory.js + product.js)
